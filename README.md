# CarRace 
## (A simple game in SDL and C as part of learning SDL.)

### Features
* Just a start

### Running the game
With gcc and required libraries, the game can be compiled with:
`gcc -lSDL -lSDL_image -lSDL_ttf main.c collision.c`

### Requirements
* libSDL
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf

All of these libraries are in standard Linux repositories.

The game can run on Windows without modifications but I stay away from Windows
for this.

### Credits
* To whom it may concern

__REMEMBER: THIS IS MY OWN VERY FIRST GAME.__
